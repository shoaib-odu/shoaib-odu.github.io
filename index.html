          <p>
            After completing my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering in 2020, I found myself drawn more and more to the world of software development. From tinkering with code since 8th grade to exploring the intricacies of microcontrollers and computer architectures during my engineering days, I discovered a deep-seated passion for creating something meaningful from lines of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on my academic journey, I realized that my true calling lies in crafting software solutions that push the boundaries of innovation and make a tangible impact on people's lives. As the COVID-19 lockdowns forced us to adapt to remote work, I seized the opportunity to delve into remote freelancing, further honing my skills in web development, crypto smart contracts, and machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eager to expand my horizons, I enrolled in a Master's program at Old Dominion University, where I delved deeper into the intricacies of software engineering. It was during an internship at MAP Communications that I experienced a pivotal moment, realizing my passion for developing full-stack AI-powered applications that resonate with users and drive meaningful change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, I'm committed to leveraging my technical expertise and creativity to build smart applications that simplify complexities and enhance people's lives. With a steadfast dedication to innovation and a vision for a future where technology serves as a catalyst for positive transformation, I'm excited to embark on this journey of creating impactful solutions that redefine what's possible in the world of software development.
